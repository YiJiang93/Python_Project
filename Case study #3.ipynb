    "1) Your business problem to solve:\n",

    "We are looking to solve the problem taking into consideration\n",

    "- User experience\n",
    "- Yelp Impact\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Why the problem is important to solve? \n",
    "\n",
    "Present Scenario - A new entrant in the market finds it really difficult to crack it's way into the list of top 10 or 20. So, its presence on yelp is greatly affected and a new business has got minimum visibility on the yelp website. On the user side, there is no section which showcases the new & trending places in their city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution - By adding a trending feature we are trying to encourage new business entities from various categories to enter the limelight of Yelp website. Also, users who see the same list of top restaurants get to view new and upcoming venues where they can try out and it can get them excited about new places. Finally, on the yelp side of business, it encourages new market entrants to join them and enhance its portfolio by getting the latest market trends or buzzing places and more user presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) How could you provide a better solution with data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science can read through all the reviews, business ids, location, categories, etc. There is a huge volume of data (1.6 GB in Yelp Challenge Dataset) that if trying to do manual will take year to find and formulate a result or test a given hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Data Science tools & techniques we can filter the data, apply mathematical models, filter the unwanted and come out with a clean & sorted outcomes. Also, we can compare and try various approaches to solve our problems in very less amount of time.\n",
